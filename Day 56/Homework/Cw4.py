print("A trusting little leaf of green,A bold audacious frost;A rendezvous, a kiss or two,And youth for ever lost.")
print("Underneath my outside faceThere's a face that none can see.A little less smiley,A little less sure,")
print("Nature's first green is gold,Her hardest hue to hold.Her early leaf's a flower;But only so an hour.")
